///This script takes care of a battle turn in the game! 
/* First, a random number is generated from 1-10. Any number below 6 means the player moves first. All other numbers
*  make the enemy move first. After one side moves, the opposing side moves. Damage is calculated by subtracting
*  the power of the character with their weapon to the target's health. Death of a character is handled in their
*  own step function. After both sides moved, the battle menu options show again. 
*  Arg0 = the player, Arg1 = the enemy, Arg2 = the battle mode object
